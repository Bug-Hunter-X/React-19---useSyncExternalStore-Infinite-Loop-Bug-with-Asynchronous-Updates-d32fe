This bug occurs when using the new React 19 features like `useSyncExternalStore` with legacy code that doesn't handle asynchronous updates correctly.  Imagine a component fetching data and updating its state with `setState`. If this happens within a `useEffect` hook that depends on the external store, it can lead to unexpected behavior and infinite loops, especially if the external store's updates aren't properly synchronized.
